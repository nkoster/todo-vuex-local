# todo-vuex-local

Todo skeleton, with Vuex state management, local storage, and sync to remote storage.

This skeleton is shamelessly inspired on Brads' (üëç) Vuex [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lVQgZzLMHc) crash course.

Original code: https://github.com/bradtraversy/vuex_todo_manager

I've replaced the JSON fake API for local storage instead, and sync that to a remote storage.

My goal is to keep stuff as simple as posible, perhaps even too simple, be carefull.

These are the steps to get the thing running from within my linux terminal:

```
sudo npm i -g @vue/cli
git clone https://github.com/nkoster/todo-vuex-local
cd todo-vuex-local
npm i
./node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js app.js &
vue ui
```

Check the UI page, import the ```todo-vuex-local``` directory as a project, and start the "serve task" for the project.
In the _output_ display, you'll see the localhost URL.

```app.js``` is the "remote storage server", running at localhost port 5000.
